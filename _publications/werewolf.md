abstract: >
    Communication is a fundamental aspect of human society, facilitating the exchange of information
    and beliefs among people. Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent agents
    built with these often neglect the control over discussion tactics, which are essential in communication
    games. As a variant of the famous communication game Werewolf, One Night Ultimate Werewolf
    (ONUW) requires sophisticated discussion tactics due to the potential role changes that increase the
    uncertainty and complexity of the game. In this work, we find Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBEs) in
    the ONUW game, illustrating the significance of using discussion tactics. Furthermore, we propose a
    novel RL-instructed language agent framework, where a policy is employed to determine appropriate
    discussion tactics to adopt. Our experiment results on the ONUW game demonstrate the effectiveness
    and generalization ability of our proposed framework.
